# unitscan - WoW Cataclysm 4.3.4 addOn 

![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/d7TLkZm.png)

This addOn automatically scans for any targetable units of your choice by name and alerts you upon finding one.

The alert is visually and acoustically an exact copy of the famous addOn *_NPCScan* which first appeared during WotLK.

There are two commands:<br/>
**/unitscan** lists the active scan targets<br/>
**/unitscan name** adds/removes **name** to/from the scan targets<br/>
